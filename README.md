Second homework assignment for the Carleton Coding Boot Camp

This is a responsive portfolio, built with:

Bootstrap
HTML
CSS

It utilizes media queries to be responsive to various screen sizes

Currently I am using placeholder images in the "about" and "portfolio" section, but will update with a profile picture/screen shots of projects as the course comes to completion.
